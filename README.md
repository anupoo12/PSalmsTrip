This Java Android Studio Project utilizes a video processing machine learning (ML) model created in Python on Google Colab. The video processing ML model is fully functional and has been tested and evaluated separately. However, when integrated into the Android application, the application crashes.
Known Issue:
While the video processing ML model is fully functional, the Android application crashes when integrating the video processing ML model. The cause of this issue is currently under investigation.
